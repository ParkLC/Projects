The purpose of this project was to develop a program that could solve any Sudoku board, using a combination of linked lists and dynamic programming concepts. 
The only file that was written by me and my team mates was Sudoku.java, SudokuP.java was written by our professor and was used for testing our program.
This project was done in 2017.
