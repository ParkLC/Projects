The purpose of this project was to provide a solution to the Weighted Activity Selection Problem. The question being this:

Imagine that you have 
an all-day pass to an amusement park and that you want to maximize the amount of time spent on 
rides (rather than maximizing the total number of rides you 
can get). Rides cannot be interrupted and one cannot be on two rides at 
the same time. 

The solution I devised used dynamic programming, finding us an optimal path through all of the different activities given.
